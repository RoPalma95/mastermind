  \t[R]ed, [G]reen, [Y]ellow, [O]range, [B]lack, [W]hite\n
  Use only the color's initial to input your code, or your guesses if you are playing as the codebreaker. The codebreaker has 12 turns to figure
  out the secret code. An asterisk (*) will indicate that a color is in the correct position. A plus sign (+) will indicate that a color
  is in the wrong position, but is part of the solution.\n
